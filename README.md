# Hi, I’m Enis

I’m a software engineer with almost **5 years of experience**, mostly building web apps.  
I work on both **frontend and backend**, and I often help with technical decisions and code reviews.

I like writing clean, understandable code and building things that people actually use.


### Tech I use DAILY
- React, Next.js  
- TypeScript  
- Node.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL  
- TailwindCSS, Vite 
- Git & GitHub
- Figma


### What I enjoy
- Clean UI and good user experience
- Security

### Open to

NOTE: Most of my projects are imported from my other github account, which is not used anymore.
